# Data Explorer

Useful for exploring all known files in FFXIV data archives. It can view models and excel sheets within the program, without having to boot up Karuku or Armoury.

## Note

Vulkan 1.3 or higher is currently required to view model files. This requirement is planned to be lifted in the future.
